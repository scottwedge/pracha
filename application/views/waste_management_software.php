				<p>Precaution is better than cure! Maintaining a clear and an infection free environment for the life to bloom to its potential is very important. As a complex of multi disciplinary structure, a hospital consumes lot of resources for appropriate delivery of medical care, and the leftovers from the consumable are turned as hospital waste. This hospital waste is named as bio-medical waste and to maintain the bio-medical waste process, Medspace has developed the best software named "Bio Medical Waste Management Software".</p>
				<p>Prachatech has developed the best biomedical waste management software that tracks biomedical waste using barcode system. It is used to track biomedical waste generated from health care facilities to its ultimate disposal. Material tracking can be easily managed through bar coding.  Health care facilities (HCF) generates barcodes for bags or containers containing biomedical waste. For hospitals having less than 30 no. of beds are not required to scan their bags containing bio-medical waste. Truck driver scans the hospital barcode and records the waste collection in app and send the details to HCF (Health Care Facilities) via email. Waste acceptance receipt comprising of date, time, no. of bags, total weight of colour coded bags/containers will be sent to the health care facilities by the CBWTF via email. </p>

			<p >The Bio-Medical waste management protocol module keeps track of the collection and disposal of Bio-medical waste produced in the Healthcare Organization. This module helps in defining, identifying and categorizing the waste produced within the healthcare organization into different categories including the radioactive waste materials. This module identifies the areas within the organization where the waste is actually generated and finally disposed off. It also manages the time frames within which the waste has to be disposed off and provides a checklist for the same. It also helps to schedule and keep track of the staff responsible for the BMW Disposal.

Waste acceptance receipt comprising of date, time, no. of bags, total weight of colour coded bags/containers will be sent to the health care facilities by the CBWTF via email. Whereas, Health Care Facilities (HCF) having 30 or more no. of beds should generate bar codes for all the bags containing bio-medical waste. The waste collected by the truck driver will be sent to the disposal plant. At the disposal plant each bag will be scanned and generates waste acceptance receipt, this acceptance report will be printed and sent to HCF via email. Daily and monthly waste collection reports can be tracked.</p>

Bar code or QR code label can be pre-printed directly on the designated colour coded bags /containers, which may be procured by HCF through the Operator of a CBWTF. These codes can be pasted on the designated colour coded bags. Pre-printed bar code label is in different colours usually in yellow, red, blue and white.</p>
